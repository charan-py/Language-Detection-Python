LANGUAGE DETECTION
It is Just a simple project to recognize the language of a sentence taken as input to this model which outputs the Language in which the input sentence written.

Language Detection: Language detection is a natural language processing task where we need to identify the language of a text or document. Using machine learning for language identification was a difficult task a few years ago because there was not a lot of data on languages, but with the availability of data with ease, several powerful machine learning models are already available for language identification.

Algorithm: Naive Bayes 
        Naive Bayes is a statistical classification technique based on Bayes Theorem. It is one of the simplest supervised learning algorithms. Naive Bayes classifier is the fast, accurate and reliable algorithm. Naive Bayes classifiers have high accuracy and speed on large datasets.

Libraries used:
        1.Numpy
        2.Pandas
        3.Sk Learn.
        
Dataset:
        It's a small language detection dataset. This dataset consists of text details for 17 different languages, ie, you will be able to predicting 17 different language:
1) English
2) Malayalam
3) Hindi
4) Tamil
5) Kannada
6) French
7) Spanish
8) Portuguese
9) Italian
10) Russian
11) Sweedish
12) Dutch
13) Arabic
14) Turkish
15) German
16) Danish
17) Greek
